## DataMenu
### V1.0
This is just a simple react contextMenu that renders the datagrid buttonbar when you right click the specified datagrid. Notting more.

## Features
-   Show a context menu when u rightclick on a datagrid. This contextmenu renders the buttons that you have declared on the datagrid menu     bar (where the default Search button is displayed)
-   (optional) hides certain buttons labeled with the 'hideInMenu' class
-   Style changes can be made in the DataMenu.css. By default it contains two simple classes
    .mx-contextMenu
    .mx-contextMenu-buttons
-   It follows the buttons order from left to right.

## Usage
1.   Add the widget on a page. 
2.   Provide it with the gridname
3.   Enjoy!
